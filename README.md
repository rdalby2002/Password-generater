# ryans-password-generater

## Description

In a world brimming with people out to steal your information, strong, varied passwords are necessary to ensure none of your online accounts become compromised. With that said, it can be difficult to come up with a strong enough password on your own, hence why I made this password generater. With it, a user can set a desired length for their password between 8 and 120 characters, and via confirmation messages, select which criteria between numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters they'd like their password too include. After doing so, they'll be presented with a randomized password containing all of the criteria they elected to at their desired length.

## Installation

NA

## Usage

To use, simply click the generate password button, answer the prompt with the number of characters you'd like your password to contain, and answer the confirm prompts for the criteria you'd like your password to include. After doing the above, you'll be presented with your secure password, at which point it can be copied and used at your discretion on any of your online accounts.
